1) Reason to Choose these Project-:
      when evaluating covid-19 data easy to decision-making govrnment as well as private sector.
      Use to number of cases active,number of cases discharge , number of cases deaths also rate. 


2) - info(),desribe(),isna(),sum()
    -drop()
    -value_counts(),groupby()
    
3)  Graph which are used-: ->For plotting i have used matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
        Bar graph
        Pie chart
        Countplot
        Heat map
        
4) Workdone-:
        - By using isna().sum() find out missing values.
        - By using describe give descriptive statistic.
        - By using info() give information.
        - I used masking technique,groupby,unique method,countplot.
        
5) Conclusion-
            This data has represented a study of covid-19 disease affect on India. -> The spread of covid-19 in India almost all state and union territory. -> From above analysis i have concluded highest total number of covid19 cases in Maharastra state where as lowest number of covid19 cases in Andaman and Nicobar. -> Kerala state is a high active cases where as Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu territoryis low active cases in India. -> Highest number of death in state of Maharastra and lowest number of death in Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. -> Utter pradesh state is a highest population state in India
            
 6) Result-
          After my analysis if any state or territory total number of cases increases number of death is increses -> Number of total cases is directly proportional to the deaths. -> Number of cases decreses deaths and deaths ratio aslo decreses.
